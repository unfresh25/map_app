# Average Percentage of Bee Colonies Affected in the U.S.

This project will visualize the data corresponding to a study of bee diseases due to different causes in the U.S. First we have a chloroplastic map to see how the percentage of bee colonies affected by different causes is distributed in the states of the country in a specific year, and then we can see how this percentage has changed over the years in each of the states.
